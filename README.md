## Executive Summary
In order to keep clients, predict behavior. [IBM Test Data Sets] If you look at the American Statista research on customer turnover, it states that cable television has a 25 percent churn rate in 2020, making it the sector in the US where customers are most likely to switch providers owing to subpar customer care. The percentage of clients you lose over the course of a time frame (month, quarter, or year) as opposed to the total number you had at the start of that time frame is known as your customer churn rate. 
You will have a 50% yearly churn rate if you lose 5% of your clients each month. In terms of revenue, you are looking at a 25–30% difference.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a fundamental problem for the telecommunication (Telco) industry. It is defined as the loss of customers moved from one Telco operator to another. If customer churn can be predicted in advance, such as “is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?”, Telco operators can apply business marketing policies to such churn customers to retain and increase the customer base. Given millions of Telco customers, even reducing the 1% churn rate will lead to a significant profit increase. 
We can roughly define the Churn analysis as the whole of analytical studies on “a customer”, “a product or service”, and “the probability of abandonment”. We aim to be aware of this situation (even the customer himself may not be aware of this situation) before the customer leaves us (approaching to leave) and then to take some preventive actions. 
Telco churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. Which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service shows?
